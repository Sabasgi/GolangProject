////////admin flow
can you tell me a simple way of designing which will show proper data based on role of user got aftter user is logged in into system . if admin is there in his login , he can see all the users of the same lab he is working , admin should be able to add delete , update user details , admin will be able to see all the branches of that lab , then he should be able to create ,udate , delete branch , admin can create department of any branch and have access of CRUD on department then admin will have access to add services to the departments and all CRUD on services . then how shall be my ui using primevue , which components shall i use to make ui interactive , and i have a sidebar which has menu list comming from backend i.e. the pages accessible to admin like /laboratories , /users , /departents
